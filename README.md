# Task Manager

Welcome to the Task Manager application! This project is a TypeScript and React-based task management tool designed to help you organize your tasks efficiently. With the added power of tailwind for styling, zod for schema validation, and localStorage for persistent storage, this Task Manager provides a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## Live Demo

## Features

- TypeScript and React: Leverage the benefits of static typing and the component-based architecture of React for a robust and maintainable codebase.

- Tailwind: Utilize the utility-first CSS framework to style components and create a clean, modern user interface.

- Zod Schema Validation: Ensure data integrity and consistency by employing zod for schema validation, making sure your tasks adhere to predefined structures.

- Local Storage: Persistently store tasks locally, allowing users to access and manage their tasks even after closing and reopening the application.

- Category Organization: Streamline your tasks by categorizing them into three predefined categories: "Work," "Personal," and "School."
